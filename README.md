## 🧠 Project Overview

This project showcases a mobile robot being **manually teleoperated via a joystick** while performing **real-time 3D mapping** using **RTAB-Map SLAM** in ROS Noetic. The robot’s movement is controlled through the `joy` ROS package, and mapping is visualized live in **RViz** using data from an **Intel RealSense D435i RGB-D camera**.

This is part of my teaching and research work for the **MAE 4270: Experimental Robotics** course at the University of Virginia.
