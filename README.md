## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates **real-time joystick-based teleoperation** of a mobile robot using the `joy` ROS package, with live visual feedback in RViz. The robot was manually controlled to explore an environment while generating a map using **RTAB-Map SLAM**.

This work was developed as part of the **MAE 4270 Experimental Robotics** course at the **University of Virginia**, focusing on **Human-Machine Interaction (HMI)** and hybrid control architectures in robotics.

## 🎯 Features Demonstrated in the Video

- Manual control of a mobile robot using a joystick/gamepad
- Real-time SLAM using RGB-D camera and RTAB-Map
- RViz-based visualization of the robot, odometry, and map
- Smooth human-in-the-loop control pipeline using ROS Noetic

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

- **ROS Noetic** on Ubuntu 20.04  
- `joy` and `teleop_twist_joy` ROS packages  
- **RTAB-Map** for visual SLAM  
- **RViz** for visualization  
- **Intel RealSense D435i** RGB-D Camera  
- Python and C++ ROS nodes  

---

## 🧪 Applications

- Human-in-the-loop robot control
- Remote inspection and exploration
- Assistive robotics and HRI
- Real-time mapping and localization

---

## 📚 Coming Soon

The full ROS package will be re-uploaded soon with:
- Python teleop control node
- RTAB-Map SLAM integration launch files
- RViz configuration

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project showcases a mobile robot being **manually teleoperated via a joystick** while performing **real-time 3D mapping** using **RTAB-Map SLAM** in ROS Noetic. The robot’s movement is controlled through the `joy` ROS package, and mapping is visualized live in **RViz** using data from an **Intel RealSense D435i RGB-D camera**.

This is part of my teaching and research work for the **MAE 4270: Experimental Robotics** course at the University of Virginia.
